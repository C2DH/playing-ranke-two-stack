You probably hear a lot about metadata here and there, especially if you work in digital environments - and who doesn't nowadays? Even if the term does not mean a lot to you, you are much likely to be concerned each time you collect your sources, organize your bibliography, analyze your historical data with use of software or publish your scientific results. If you use software like Tropy to organize the images of your research materials or Zotero for your bibliographical references, then you are definitely in touch with metadata, even if you don't know or - let's be honest! - if you don't care a lot about it. But you definitely should! Metadata is a powerful asset for you to assess, let's say, the authenticity or the provenance of your sources. In other words, metadata is important for you to do your work as a historian. Let us see together some aspects you might be interested in."
